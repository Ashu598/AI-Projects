              "\" Guys don't buy anything from these scammers. I purchased my car policy from Reliance General Insurance through them and after 3 months I received a letter asking me to pay rs 960 stating I am not eligible for NCB as I have claim from my previous insurance policy. I gave them no Claim letter from ICICI. Now they are saying sorry but still I have to pay else they will void my policy. Seriously am shocked by the kind of scam they are running is broad daylight.My ears are bleeding now. Keep calling. I am coming for you with a bat.Policy bazaar uses unethical business practices to sell false policiesWhy the customer care is harassing us by calling us frequentlyThey make fool of customer... at the time of taking money they call you 1000 times and drop slaiva like a dog from mouth and once they have taken money nobody bothers even your claom settled or not .. or you are satisfied or not not even pick call and give excuse and blame each other department like govt banks ..instead of helping customer... policy bazaar is a fraudBad feedback in app My money loss in app KApp does not starts. Always shows the loading screen but never starts.Bad experience with PB I try to November for car insurance but no any reply from PB .very bad experiences with PB.Faltu app. I'm not able to claim the insurance. It says that it's fetching the details of the vehicle but doesn't proceed further. Bad experience. Only good at making advertisements. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽApp not Opening I am using redmi note 7, every time i open it, it says sorry app can't be opened, plz fix itFraud selling agents and worst customer service. I would strongly recommend not to buy anything from policy bazar. If you want to save something for future visit your financial advisor and meet them face to face and purchase policy from them and clear your doubts. This fraudsters will commit anything and everything and then straight away deny when you need their help. I lost Rs 6898 for the miscommitment and incorrect information provided to me by their unskilled sales agentsDear all initally i have given 5 star once i paid the premium but now i thing its not worth even 1 star. Totally they are fooling customer . Taken policy in mar 20 with premium of 16380 And post 5 month they have cancelled and intated refund without intimating me now for the same policy they are asking 20500. This is how they fool customer. Would request user not to rely on this app. Just taking your money and after 6 month refunding it without any reason. Will take this up to Ombudsman for suredont register yourself with this app , the policy bazzar guys will call you 10-15 times a day n make your life horrible.Never install, by installing you are allowing their workforce to call atleast twice dailyAfter entering all details, before payment page app keeps loading. Doesn't move forward.App is good ... Everything is elobrated but one thing is most annoying that you get multiple random calls almost every day whether you are in meeting, driving,or having lunch dinner.....Please don't call if we search any policy through your app as we get all the details precisely through your well developed app ...Plz it is my utmost request don't disturb anyone..I am afraid of searching anything else from this app because of this annoying reason. ThanksGuys u are talking bout app i took the interview ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ this company is nothing but a big horror house...the person taking the interview was pathetic ,racist, horrible and i would say a sadist..he was taking ops round and he treated candidates lik animals. guys pls never ever join this company..ohh my God saved me from this company.must be my good karma in past..i don't knw why companies lik policy bazaar continues to exist.i m not throwing some shade...i m actually throwing all the shade i canFake app my credit score 715 result sorry no loneIt is a worst app i ever seen.....before taking a policy, their customer support personal will make u mad for provoking to taking a policy and also give u so many promise from policy bazar.....if u trust them then u will become a mad, just like me........trust me after taking a policy from them THEY WILL HAVE NO INTEREST ON U AND ON UR POLICY........i dont want to give them any single star but there is no option for this purpose i am giving a star.....They call you when you have a query about new policy. They don't when it's about existing policy . Try not to buy policy with them.1 star bhi jyda hai inke liye ..Policy is just the name of the market, it is zero at the ground level...Not a policy since 15 days or after that without calling the customer and quietly refunding.I have never seen such bad service.I will tell people to never take a policy from them. You can directly go to the company office and take it.It's just a big bruhonce visited to site regularly call it's very much disturbedNo option to logout from all devices. Guys valuable policies and data is in your app. Please give us the option to logout from all devices. I raised a complaint as well to logout my account. Dont know when it will be done.

They will call you multiple times. But after sales they will not call you for your problems. Not recomending at all. Because policy sale is easy. But support is matter. Local agent recomended.I made a mistake of searching health insurance 2 months back. They have spammed my number so much that I daiky get spam calls asking about health insurance. If you dont want your number to get spammed, please get your insurance from somewhere else.

After I paid the amount no response from the executive. Very poor customer care service. Customer care service executives don't have any knowledge. Don't recommend. Please choose another way to take insurance and service. Better to directly take the insurance from the providers not from the Policy bazaar.Updated the app, just to find out that two wheeler insurance and car insurance options have been removed. if I am not able to use the app for buying motor insurance then the app is useless to meApp could get better like your customer servicepolicy bazaar is a fake type app no quick solutions for customers i don't like this app ðŸ˜”Worst app. Was just checking some plans on the app. After that, they started to spam a lot, and it's too irritating. Daily more than 5 calls from different numbers. This is the worst part about the policybazar.I've taken my car insurance from Policybazzar, payment also done. But I didn't get any confirmation from the team and I didn't get insurance alsoHi Team, I found this app very helpful but not getting the option to edit my profile. Actually by mistake I have entered my incorrect DOB there and now not able to edit it. Because of this reason i am not able to see my Free Credit Report as well. Please suggest how can i edit my DOB. I tried to uninstall and reinstall later as well but still everytime i enter the mobile number it fetches the old information. Please check.You advertisement have anti national person that why I uninstalled the appSelling policies for your own benefit only and making us pay more premium by cheating n hiding many many charges and also making use buy unnecessary add ons. Never ever recieved genuine advise by policy bazaar. Always advised as per policy bazaar uses policies and encouraging to buy extra add ons. Worst experience from long time in polic bazaar. Never genuine... Never trust these peoplePlease please dont download this app ... This is not policybazaar this is cheating bazaar they deducted money but not give insuranceFuel selection issue, while selecting fuel during addition of car to the profile - 'something went wrong, try again later'Very bad experience. I applied for a term life insurance in early March 20. Having all relevant things cleared, they are not able to get the policy issued till now. No representative is responsible to give reply for the delay even though they don't talk to me if I forward a request for communication with them. I really disappointed with their shameful behaviour.Worst service, Customer service section is very bad. I have booked a health policy for my mother on September 3 but till this date(22/9/21)the medical check up not done. I have called the customer services several times. They will tell we will contact you, but not done.Payment already deducted,and insurance policy not givenPathetic Experience! The auto debit feature is just useless.

I had purchased insurance for two wheeler from PB since then I have been getting irrirating and disturbing calls from policy bazar. That too from 7 to 8 different numbers. Made a mistake that I purchased policy from this app...never gonna do it again... Very disturbing and irritating...ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽThey are great at scamming people by first taking the money and then fail to render the policy in accordance with the commitment.don't have any option to close my account..What a pathetic latest version not showing addons features which was in in the old version . In the latest version they are missings addons are very much required. Also that my another car is going to 15 year but they are showing no idv for it but other apps are showing and providing value even after 15 years. Policybazaar do check it.This is a fraud company. Once they've got your payment they'll simply put your insurance on waiting. When you tries to contact them, they'd rise some random rules and excuses. I've decided to file a complaint against this companyGajab but pdf send me to letVery bad app Don't download it. After download large number of calls starts ring on your phone. Very bad experienceWhen we want to get policy they help a lot, then after they can't help us as compared beforeBe aware of this app They are making us fool I bought two wheeler insurance policy . After buying they send us pdf . When i authenticate from government website and insurance company website they just showing this insurance does not exist. Buy at your riskAs per my personal experience. Please, don't get yourself fooled by an advertisement on tv & buy a policy here. The customer service is worst & an executives are totally stupid. They will fill your mail & inbox with nothing and once you pay for a premium, executives will get vanished. No offense but the customer service need a big time training. It's not only about showing respect & discipline to the client but also to use the brain in every step. Go with old school & buy everything offline.HOPELESS SERVICE BY POLICY BAZAAR. I am fade up of your hopeless service. I had requested to cancel my health top-up policy of Niva Bupa on 10 Oct 2024, but till date no call is received from your retention department. Do you still have retention department or closed it??!!Third class company...if you only inquire from policy bazar .....company start calling you all the day and employess are also totally third claasssss..........dont share your mobile number ...........Never ever buy anything from policy bazzar. They are the cheaters. Once \\nthey got your money forget those money you will get nothing. I booked \\nhealth policy and next day due to some reason i have cancelled it. They \\nagreed for refund but whenever i asked for it they giving excuses but not \\nrefund. For that finally I have to reach IRDAI and then it got settled. Its \\nmy personal experience.At the time of registration, app isn't taking BH-Series numbers as vehicle registration numberI purchased on policy from this application. But as I found another one suitable for me. I cancelled my previous policy. But after 20 days now I haven't received my refund back.. And most important thing is that customer service is very poor. No body want to help.fake app , they are liars. , do fake commutments to cm.Has some technical glitch...doesn't accept age in travel insurance...says invalid DOBAlways print wrong start and eand date of vehicle policy,When I took a policy from this for my friend, the policy came in my nameNow no insurance for scooter I will never use policy bazaar againStop calling me otherwise I have to take some legal action against youYou start getting flood of calls by just by opening this app and giving your phone number.
